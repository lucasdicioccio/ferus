Here it's Férus, which stands for Framework Elegant en RUby et SDL.

~~~~~
ABOUT
~~~~~
Férus aims to be a simple frameworks to develop little games with ruby.
At least for curious people.

For the story, at the beginning, I wanted to create a game with SDL and
ruby and started to create to understand SDL. As I wanted to make my
code re-useable, I tried to make useful tools. This also means that the
codeline will follow the codeline of my future game.
Moreover, the kernel-style code may be re-used in other fields.
Due to low efficiency of Ruby and my ignorance in openGL, I
do not plan to support 3D.

~~~~~~~
WARNING
~~~~~~~
That's a development version. It may change a lot and needs a lot of
improvements. A LOT of SDL features are not ready, thus I imagine it's
already possible to create some stupid games.
Moreover, it only has been tested on linux with ruby 1.8.5 (and over).

~~~~~~~~~~
EFFICIENCY
~~~~~~~~~~
Férus don't aim to be an almighty frameworks, the more it helps you,
the less you'll have freedom to optimize. As its goal is to do an
acceptable engine for some 2D games, it will definitely don't be
optimal for each genre of games. As an example, don't expect to do a
first person shooter with férus.

Ruby as some problem when dealing with threads : it has its native 
so-called "green-thread", so, for now, it can simply "wait" for an
event. We have to spinlock and thus, consumes a lot of CPU power. The
problem will logically be solved with coming versions of Ruby.

If you don't understand the previous paragraph, well, it's not an
issue, just remember that Férus will waste a lot of CPU power and avoid
making havoc in the /base directory ;).

~~~~~~~
INSTALL
~~~~~~~
There is still no installer, I will certainly create a gem later.
To run the frameworks, at current state, you will need ruby, SDL
and rubySDL bindings.

NOTES ON SDL FOR LAZY GUYS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RubySDL must be compiled with SDL_image extension to import PPX,XPM,PCX,
GIF,JPEG,PNG and TGA files
RubySDL must be compiled with the mixer to use the mixer.

To use SDL.autolock, SGE must be installed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOCUMENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I Will soon make a documentation, for now, the code is readable and has
several comments on the key-points. Since it changes often and will 
certainly change again, I don't spend my energy doing a doc.
I guess it's not too hard to understand. See the dumb example in ./app.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TROUBLESHOOTING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I hope you wont get in trouble, nevertheless, you can contact me for
details.
At the moment try to follow the arborescence of dumb example. If you
have path errors.
